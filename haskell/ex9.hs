Lemma xs ++ (ys ++ zs) = (xs ++ ys) ++ zs
Proof
  1. [] ++ ([] ++ []) = [] ++ [] = ([] ++ []) ++ []
  2. x:xs ++ (ys ++ zs) = x:(xs ++ (ys ++ zs)) = x:((xs ++ ys) ++ zs )
      = x:(xs ++ ys) ++ zs = (x:xs ++ ys) ++ zs

Theorem reverse . reverse = id
Proof
  reverse (reverse (x1:xs)) = reverse (reverse xs ++ [x1]) = ... =
    = reverse ( [xn] ++ ... ++ [x1] ) -- bo xs jest skoÅ„czone
    = reverse ( [xn, ... , x1 ] )
    = reverse ( xn:[xn-1, ... , x1] )
    = reverse ( [xn-1, ... , x1] ) ++ [xn]
    = ... = [x1] ++ ... ++ [xn]
